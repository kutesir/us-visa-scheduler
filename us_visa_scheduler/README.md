# visa_rescheduler

The `visa_rescheduler` is a bot for monitoring US VISA (usvisa-info.com) appointment available dates. It can automatically reschedule to the earliest date it finds on your behalf, and optionally notify you when that happens.

This enhanced version adds real-time **Telegram alerts**, improved error handling with screenshots, and support for SendGrid and Pushover.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- ‚ùå **403 from GitHub**: Use a [PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or switch to SSH
- ‚ùå **Blank screenshots**: The page may not have loaded yet; try increasing `STEP_TIME`
- ‚ùå **No available dates found**: Widen your `PRIOD_START` / `PRIOD_END` range
